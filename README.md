## General Information
- There are a number of particle tracking software for cell biology. However, there was a lack of specialized data analysis and visualisation tool for it.
- This project aims to fulfill this gap.
- I have realized an easy way of doing it, which developed into this massive project.

## Technologies Used
- R
- R Shiny

## Features
List the ready features here:
- TraXpert recognizes file naming pattern and the experimental groups in that pattern.
- TraXpert automates data visualization and analysis but also is flexible enough.
- TraXpert offers tracking specific data visualization, such as trajectory plots, directionality plots (aka radar plots or Nightingale plots).


## Screenshots

## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_


## Room for Improvement
3D migration directionality requires more testing and perhaps correction. Currently, this feature shouldn't be used.

To do:
- Test on Imaris format
